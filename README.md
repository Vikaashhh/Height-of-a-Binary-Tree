# 🌲 Day 81 — GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 📏 Problem: Height of a Binary Tree | Recursion & Depth
### 🧩 Problem Statement:
Calculate the height of a binary tree — the longest path from root to leaf in terms of node depth.

## 🛠️ Approach & Strategy:
✅ Employed recursive DFS to explore both left and right subtrees
✅ Base Case: If node is None, return -1 (or 0 depending on definition)
✅ Height = 1 + max(left_subtree, right_subtree)
✅ Elegant and minimal recursion—simple yet powerful!

## 🚀 Submission Stats:
✅ Test Cases Passed: 1115 / 1115

💯 Accuracy: 100%

🧠 Attempts: 1 / 1

🕐 Time Taken: 0.05s

🎯 Points Scored: 2 / 2

## ✍️ Key Insight:
Recursion is your best friend when working with trees.
The divide-and-conquer approach simplifies even the deepest structures.
